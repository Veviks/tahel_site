# What I need from your Figma to build the site

To match your design as closely as possible, here’s what helps:

## 1. **Share the Figma file**
- **View-only link**: In Figma, click **Share** → enable **“Anyone with the link can view”** → copy the link.  
  With that I can see layout, colors, fonts, and structure (no edit access needed).
- If the file is private, you can instead export the frames (see below) and share those.

## 2. **Export assets (images & graphics)**
- **Images/photos**: Select frame or image → right‑click → **Export** → PNG (1x or 2x) or JPG.  
  Put them in a folder (e.g. `images/`) and tell me the structure.
- **Icons / logos**: Export as **SVG** when possible so they stay sharp and small.
- If you prefer, you can zip the whole `images` folder and add it to the repo (or tell me where it is).

## 3. **Design specs (optional but helpful)**
- **Colors**: Hex codes (e.g. `#1a1a2e`) from the design. I can also read them from the shared Figma link.
- **Fonts**: Font names and weights (e.g. “Inter, 400 and 600”). If they’re from Google Fonts, even better.
- **Spacing / layout**: Rough idea of sections (hero, about, video, etc.) and what should be full‑width vs contained.

## 4. **Prototype / navigation**
- Your **prototype** is very useful. From it I need:
  - **Which buttons or links** go to **which screen** (e.g. “Start” → “Home”, “About” → “About page”).
  - **Names of each screen** (e.g. Home, About, Videos, Contact).
- A short list like “Button A → Page X, Button B → Page Y” is enough; or describe the flow in a few sentences.

## 5. **Videos**
- **Where are the videos?**  
  - Hosted on **YouTube** or **Vimeo** → I only need the share/embed URLs.  
  - Or you’ll upload files → I’ll add placeholders and you can drop the files into a `videos/` folder later.
- **Placement**: Which page each video is on and any short caption or title.

## Quick checklist

- [ ] Figma view link (or exported frames + assets)
- [ ] Exported images in a folder (e.g. `images/`)
- [ ] Icons/logos as SVG if possible
- [ ] List of pages and which buttons go to which page
- [ ] Video URLs or “I’ll add files later”
- [ ] (Optional) Colors and font names

Once you share the Figma link (and any exports/notes), I can build the site to match and set it up so you can send a link and host it on GitHub.
