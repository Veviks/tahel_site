# Tahel's site

A simple multi-page site with navigation and video support, ready for GitHub Pages.

## What’s included

- **Pages**: Home (`index.html`), About (`about.html`), Videos (`videos.html`)
- **Navigation**: Buttons/links in the header to move between pages
- **Videos**: Placeholder for YouTube/Vimeo embeds and for your own video files
- **Styling**: Basic CSS you can replace with your Figma design

## Run locally

Open `index.html` in your browser, or run a local server:

```bash
# Python 3
python3 -m http.server 8000
# Then open http://localhost:8000
```

## Publish on GitHub (so you can send a link)

1. Push this folder to a GitHub repo (e.g. `tahel_site`).
2. In the repo: **Settings → Pages**.
3. Under **Source** choose **Deploy from a branch**.
4. Branch: **main** (or **master**), folder: **/ (root)**.
5. Save. After a minute, the site will be at:  
   `https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/tahel_site/`

## Next steps

- Share your **Figma link** and any **exported images** so the layout and assets can match the design.
- Tell me **which buttons go to which pages** (from your prototype).
- Send **video URLs** (YouTube/Vimeo) or say you’ll add video files later.

See **FIGMA_GUIDE.md** for a detailed list of what helps from Figma.
